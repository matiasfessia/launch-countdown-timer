# About the project

I build this project to solve a frontend coding challenge described on https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-.

In short words, the challenge is to build out a countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The visitors should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- Bonus: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

Finally, you can visit https://launch-countdown-timer-six.vercel.app/ to see the project running.

I hope you enjoy it :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
